The goal of this project is ,Predicting and understanding factors affecting customers acceptance of coupon for vehicle service.
By analysing the features we aim to identify patterns that indicae whether a customer is likely to redeem coupon.
This insight can help business in automotive industry to apply more effective marketing strategies.
Importing necessary libraries
-pandas & numpy: Are essential data manipulation libraries in python.
-Pandas is used for data handling and analysis
-numpy is used for numerical analysis.
-matplolib & seaborn : These libarries are used for data visualization.
KEY PROCESS:
OneHotEncoder : This encoder is uesed for transform categorical data into numerical form which is essential for machine lerning algorithm
StandardScaler : It rescales the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1
train_test_split : one of the most important process in data preprocessing involves splitting the data set into train and test set. By doing this we can enhance the performance of our model and hence provide better predictability
Select KBest : this feature selection tool help to select the top k features based on statical test
warnings : This can make the analysis smoother and the results easier to interpret without irrelevant warning messages
